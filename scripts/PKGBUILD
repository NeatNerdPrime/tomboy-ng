# This file is used to build a pacman usable gtk2 package for tomboy-ng

# Requirments : sudo pacman -S base-devel fpc lazarus-gtk2 unzip

# Usage : VER=0.34 makepkg --skipinteg 
#         VER=master makepkg --skipinteg 

# Maintainer tomboy-ng@bannons.id.au

# Note : buildit.bash in 0.34 and earlier will not work on non-Debian systems
# so necessary to replace with later buildit.bash.

# I cannot put the download sha in this script because, obviously, editing
# this file alters the sha.  So, its set to check (my) KControls but skip
# tomboy-ng's.

# Once a tagged release happens we can download the tar ball and run -
# shasum -a 256 v0.35.tar.gz (or whatever) and hardwire that sha AND the ver
# into a local version of this file, one dedicated to just that release version.
