# This is the Lintian override file for the tomboy-ng binary.
# It ultimatly lives in /usr/share/lintian/overrides
# and is called tomboy-ng there.
#
# tomboy-ng is built using the fpc, not gcc. So use of CPPFLAGS
# is not possible. PIE, Read-only relocations and Immediate bindings
# are enabled but Fortify Source functions is not.
tomboy-ng binary: hardening-no-fortify-functions

# Its necessary to use xcb because Wayland does not yet
# support a window reporting its screen coordinates nor
# opening a window in a particular place.
# Therefore, we set an env in the Exec command. 
# The actual command does follow the env setting.

# FPC has a known bug on ppc64el that prevents hardening.
