# This is the Lintian override file for the tomboy-ng binary.
# It ultimatly lives in /usr/share/lintian/overrides
# and is called tomboy-ng there.
#
# tomboy-ng is built using the fpc, not gcc. So use of CPPFLAGS
# is not possible. PIE, Read-only relocations and Immediate bindings
# are enabled but Fortify Source functions is not.

# Upstream issues (Lazarus, Qt5) make it necessary to tell
# this app to use qt5ct, that means setting an env var 
# that Lintian seems to thinkis the command. When 
# Lazarus 3.0 is available, remove this.
