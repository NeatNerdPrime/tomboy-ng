# This is the Lintian override file for the tomboy-ng binary.
# It ultimatly lives in /usr/share/lintian/overrides
# and is called tomboy-ng there.
#
# tomboy-ng is built using the fpc, not gcc. So use of CPPFLAGS
# is not possible. PIE, Read-only relocations and Immediate bindings
# are enabled but Fortify Source functions is not.

# support a window reporting its screen coordinates nor
# opening a window in a particular place.

# The actual command does follow the env setting.
