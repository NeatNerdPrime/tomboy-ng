Description: Tomboy Notes rewritten for easy installation and cross platform.
 Tomboy-ng notes allows easy management of any number of notes. Notes can 
 contain a range of font sizes, bold, italic and highlight. Auto links between
 notes (bi-directional) and notes can be organised into NoteBooks. 
 Available for Linux, Windows amd Mac and easy sync between them.
 This is the gtk2 based version. See the tomboy-ng wiki if you use Gnome about
 the System Tray Icon.
